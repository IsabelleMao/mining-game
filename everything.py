  '''Mine generating resources. I THINK I figured this out. Got stuck in so many infinite loops (6) trying to work this out.
  Oh, needs to generate every x seconds. Don't know how to do that.
  Here the maximum gold the player can have is 500 and the goldMine (should) generates 100 gold every (x seconds) and adds it to gold?
  The "+100" should show above the goldMine indicating that it's generating/working.
